"""stays — Google Hotels/Travel search client.

Reverse-engineered ``batchexecute`` client with an MCP-compatible surface
(three tools, two prompts, one configuration resource). The public
package surface re-exports filters, result models, and the MCP entry
points so callers can write ``from stays import SearchHotels``.

# MCP surface — shipped in core since 0.1.0, so this import should always
# succeed in normal installs. The ONLY expected failure mode is a user
# who manually uninstalled the optional ``fastmcp`` runtime; everything
# else (broken stays.mcp module, ImportError for names we control, etc.)
# must surface loudly rather than be silently swallowed.
#
# We deliberately do NOT re-export the ``mcp`` FastMCP instance here: it
# would shadow the ``stays.mcp`` subpackage on the ``stays`` namespace,
# which breaks Python 3.10's ``unittest.mock.patch`` dotted-path lookup
# (3.11+ recovers; 3.10 does not). Callers that need the FastMCP object
# can still reach it at ``stays.mcp.mcp``.
